    <h1>About Us : </h1>
    <p>This website was created in order to help people generate thousands of emails using their gmail account.
        It uses a method called the "gmail dot trick", which is
        a well-known method, which consists of putting dots between
        each character of your email address. You can use our website to Bypass Filters: Some websites
        restrict sign-ups or limit features based on email addresses. By using the Gmail dot trick, you
        can create multiple accounts that all forward to your main inbox.
        We hope you will make good use of this tool, and Happy Generating!.
